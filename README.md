# Fixico's Damage Report submission app

## Introduction

Fixico's customers need a way to submit their damages. This project is the first version of a Damage Report submission app.
The wireframes of the app are in [public/images/wireframes].

In this app, you should be able to do the following things:

1. Submit a Damage Report with vehicle information, a photo of the damage and customer information from a range of vehicle brands and models that are registered.
2. View the status of a single previously created Damage Report.
3. View an overview of all previously created Damage Reports in a list.

## Tech Stack

- Next Js platform to create a full-stack Web application by extending the latest React features.
- React Hook Forms for validation without hassle.
- Material UI for a comprehensive suite of UI tools.
- Node server-side.
- Jest unit testing to ensure correctness of the JavaScript codebase.

All changes are in Branch - Main.
